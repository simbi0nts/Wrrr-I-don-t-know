# Wrrr-I-don-t-know
Yeah, that's exactly how I'm gonna name it

It's a ~~very~~ simple project (I can't even call it a game yet)~~, that I created in a couple of days~~.

And yeah, It's the dynamic lighting. In Tkinter.

All you need are Tkinter (I've been using Tk 8.6, but it also may be working with many other versions. But I've never checked), python 3.x (works just fine with 3.6.6), keyboard(0.13.2) and some sudo if you are linux ~~master race~~ user.
